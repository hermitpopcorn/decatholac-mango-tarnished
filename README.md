## What is this?
This is just [decatholac MANGO (dM)](https://github.com/hermitpopcorn/decatholac-mango) rewritten in Rust. Everything's just gonna be more or less the same.

## About the weird name

I'm bad at names. Google lists "tarnished" as a synonym to "rusty" which is the language of this rewrite, so that's what I chose.

Also, tarnished is a name in Elden Ring
